# Flight-Fare-Prediction-Project

This project aims to predict the prices of flight tickets based on various features like airline, source, destination, duration, and number of stops. The project uses machine learning algorithms to train on a dataset of flight prices and then predicts the fare of new flights.

Here are the contents of the project:
1. Dataset:
    The dataset used for this project is a modified version of the Flight Price Prediction Dataset available on Kaggle. It contains information about flights from           various airlines in India from March 2019 to June 2019.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    The EDA is performed to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between the features and the target variable (fare).
3. Feature Engineering:
    Feature engineering is performed to create new features from the existing features and prepare the data for machine learning algorithms.
4. Machine Learning:
    The dataset is split into training and testing sets and different machine learning algorithms are trained and tested on the data.
    The best-performing model is saved in a pickle file called "model.pkl" in the "models" folder.
